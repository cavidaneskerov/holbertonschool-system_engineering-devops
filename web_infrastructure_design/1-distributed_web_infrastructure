# Three-Server Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com

## Overview
This repository contains a three-server web infrastructure diagram and explanation.  
The design hosts the website **www.foobar.com** using 1 load balancer and 2 application servers.  
It improves availability and scalability compared to a single-server architecture.

## How a User Accesses the Website
A user enters **www.foobar.com** in their browser.  
DNS resolves `www` to the load balancer’s public IP.  
The user’s browser sends an HTTP request over TCP/IP to the load balancer, which distributes the request to one of the backend servers.

## Infrastructure Components

## 1. Load Balancer (HAProxy)
### Why it is added
- To distribute traffic between two servers.
- To increase availability (if one backend server fails, the other continues working).
- To improve scalability.

### Load Balancing Algorithm
**Round Robin** is used.  
It works by sending each new incoming request to the next server in a cyclic order:
- Request 1 → Server A  
- Request 2 → Server B  
- Request 3 → Server A  
This ensures even distribution.

### Active-Active vs Active-Passive
This architecture uses **Active-Active**:
- Both backend servers are running and serving requests at the same time.
- Load balancer distributes traffic to both.

**Active-Passive** difference:
- Only one server handles traffic.
- The other server stays idle (standby) until the primary fails.

---

## 2. Two Backend Servers
Each backend server contains:

### **Nginx (Web Server)**
- Serves static content.
- Receives traffic from load balancer.
- Passes dynamic requests to the application server.
