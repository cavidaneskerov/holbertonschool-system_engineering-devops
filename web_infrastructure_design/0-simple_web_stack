# One-Server Web Infrastructure (www.foobar.com)

## Overview
This directory contains a simple one-server web infrastructure diagram and explanation.  
The setup hosts the website reachable at **www.foobar.com** using a classic LAMP-style architecture.

---

## How a User Accesses the Website
A user enters **www.foobar.com** in their browser.  
The browser resolves the domain name to the server’s IP address (`8.8.8.8`) through DNS and establishes a network connection using HTTP/HTTPS. The request is then handled by the web server.

## Infrastructure Components

### 1. Domain Name
- The domain `foobar.com` has a **DNS A record**:
  - `www` → `8.8.8.8`
- Its job is to translate a human-readable name into an IP address.

### 2. Server
A server is a physical or virtual machine that runs software to handle client requests.  
Our single server hosts:
- Nginx (web server)
- Application server
- Application code
- MySQL database

### 3. Web Server (Nginx)
- Receives HTTP requests from users.
- Serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images).
- For dynamic requests, forwards them to the application server.

### 4. Application Server
- Executes the application logic.
- Processes dynamic content.
- Interacts with the database.
- Returns responses back through the web server.

### 5. Application Files
- The codebase (HTML, backend code, configuration files).

### 6. Database (MySQL)
- Stores persistent data such as users, posts, orders, etc.
- Responds to queries from the application server.

### 7. Communication
The server communicates with the user's browser using:
- **HTTP/HTTPS** over TCP/IP.

## Issues With This Architecture

### 1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
If this single server goes down, the entire website becomes unreachable.

### 2. Downtime During Maintenance
Deploying new code or restarting services results in unavoidable downtime.

### 3. Cannot Scale Easily
If traffic increases heavily, the single server cannot handle all requests.  
You cannot add more servers or load balance with this design.
